CLASSES:

1. StyleMerger
   Purpose: A class to merge styles from styles.xml and numbering.xml into the document schema from document.xml
   Description: This class handles the complex process of style inheritance and application in DOCX documents. It resolves based-on styles, applies numbering properties, and applies default properties according to specific inheritance rules.

   INHERITANCE RULES:
   1. **Styles Inheritance**: Styles defined in styles.xml can be based on other styles. Properties from base styles are inherited unless overridden in the inheriting style.
   2. **Numbering Properties**: Numbering definitions in numbering.xml can specify properties such as indentation. These properties are applied to paragraphs that have associated numbering.
   3. **Default Properties**: Default properties can be specified in styles.xml for paragraphs and runs. These defaults are applied last, filling in any missing properties.

   METHODS:

   __init__(self, document_schema: DocumentSchema, styles_schema: StylesSchema, numbering_schema: NumberingSchema)
   Purpose: Initializes the StyleMerger with document schema, styles schema, and numbering schema
   Parameters:
   - document_schema (DocumentSchema): The schema containing elements from document.xml
   - styles_schema (StylesSchema): The schema containing styles and defaults from styles.xml
   - numbering_schema (NumberingSchema): The schema containing numbering definitions from numbering.xml
   Description: Sets up the merger with all necessary schemas and immediately begins the style resolution and merging process by calling resolve_based_on_styles() and merge_styles().

   resolve_based_on_styles(self)
   Purpose: Resolves styles that are based on other styles by merging their properties
   Description: Ensures that all properties from base styles are inherited correctly. For each style that is based on another style (base style), merges the properties of the base style into the inheriting style. This process continues recursively for styles based on other styles, creating a complete inheritance chain.

   merge_styles(self)
   Purpose: Merges styles into the document schema
   Description: Applies the complete style merging process to all document elements. The inheritance rule is:
   1. Apply numbering properties first if the paragraph has associated numbering
   2. Then apply style properties defined in styles.xml
   3. Finally, apply default properties defined in styles.xml
   
   Processes both standalone paragraphs and paragraphs within table cells.

   merge_paragraph_styles(self, paragraph: Paragraph)
   Purpose: Merges styles into a paragraph
   Parameters:
   - paragraph (Paragraph): The paragraph to merge styles into
   Description: Coordinates the application of all style types to a single paragraph in the correct order: numbering properties, style properties, and default properties.

   apply_numbering_properties(self, paragraph: Paragraph)
   Purpose: Applies numbering properties to a paragraph
   Parameters:
   - paragraph (Paragraph): The paragraph to apply numbering properties to
   Description: If a paragraph has associated numbering, merges the numbering properties (e.g., indentation) from numbering.xml. Looks up the numbering instance and level to find the appropriate properties to apply.

   apply_style_properties(self, paragraph: Paragraph)
   Purpose: Applies style properties to a paragraph
   Parameters:
   - paragraph (Paragraph): The paragraph to apply style properties to
   Description: If a paragraph has a style_id, merges the properties from the corresponding style in styles.xml. Applies both paragraph properties and run properties from the style definition.

   find_style(self, style_id: str) -> Optional[Style]
   Purpose: Finds a style by its ID
   Parameters:
   - style_id (str): The ID of the style to find
   Returns: Optional[Style] - The found style, or None if not found
   Description: Searches through the styles schema to locate a style with the specified ID. Used for style lookup during inheritance resolution and property application.

   apply_default_properties(self, paragraph: Paragraph)
   Purpose: Applies default properties to a paragraph
   Parameters:
   - paragraph (Paragraph): The paragraph to apply default properties to
   Description: Applies default properties including the default paragraph style and document default properties. The inheritance rule is:
   - If a paragraph does not have a style_id, apply the default paragraph style properties
   - Merge the document default properties (doc_defaults_ppr for paragraphs and doc_defaults_rpr for runs) last to ensure all properties are filled

INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES:
- document_schema: The document schema being processed
- styles_schema: The styles schema containing style definitions
- numbering_schema: The numbering schema containing list definitions

DATA MODELS USED:
- DocumentSchema: Complete document structure with elements
- StylesSchema: Style definitions and defaults
- NumberingSchema: Numbering and list definitions
- Paragraph: Individual paragraph elements
- Table: Table elements containing paragraphs
- Style: Individual style definitions
- ParagraphStyleProperties: Paragraph-level formatting properties

DEPENDENCIES:
- Document, styles, and numbering parsers for data extraction
- Utility functions for property merging
- Pydantic models for structured data representation

USAGE CONTEXT:
This merger is a critical component in the DOCX processing pipeline. It bridges the gap between raw parsed data and formatted document representation by:
- Resolving complex style inheritance chains
- Applying numbering formatting to list items
- Ensuring all elements have complete formatting information
- Creating a unified document representation ready for conversion

STYLE INHERITANCE PROCESS:
1. **Base Style Resolution**: Recursively resolve based-on relationships in styles
2. **Numbering Application**: Apply list-specific formatting properties
3. **Style Application**: Apply named style properties to elements
4. **Default Application**: Fill in missing properties with document defaults

ERROR HANDLING:
- Handles missing base styles gracefully by breaking inheritance chains
- Continues processing when numbering instances or levels are not found
- Provides fallback behavior when styles are not found
- Uses safe property merging to avoid overwriting existing properties

MAIN SECTION:
The file includes a main section that demonstrates the complete workflow:
1. Loading a DOCX file and parsing all components
2. Creating parsers for document, styles, and numbering
3. Initializing the StyleMerger with all schemas
4. Outputting processed table cell properties as an example

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Uses recursive style resolution to handle multi-level inheritance
- Maintains proper order of property application for correct precedence
- Handles both paragraph-level and run-level property inheritance
- Integrates with the broader document processing pipeline
- Provides complete style resolution for accurate document representation
