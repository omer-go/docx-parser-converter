DOCX PARSER CONVERTER - NUMBERING_MODELS.PY DOCUMENTATION
==========================================================

FILE PURPOSE:
This file defines Pydantic data models for representing numbering and list structures in DOCX documents. It provides models for numbering levels, numbering instances, and the overall numbering schema that handles numbered and bulleted lists in documents.

IMPORTS:
- pydantic.BaseModel, pydantic.Field: For data validation and modeling
- typing.List, typing.Optional: For type hints
- docx_parser_converter.docx_parsers.models.styles_models.FontProperties: For font properties
- docx_parser_converter.docx_parsers.models.styles_models.IndentationProperties: For indentation properties

FUNCTIONS:
None defined in this file.

CLASSES/DATA MODELS:

1. NumberingLevel(BaseModel)
   Purpose: Represents a specific level in a numbering scheme
   Fields:
   - numId (int): The ID of the numbering definition (required)
   - ilvl (int): The indent level of the numbering (required)
   - start (int): The start value for the numbering level (required)
   - numFmt (str): The format of the numbering (e.g., decimal, bullet) (required)
   - lvlText (str): The text to be displayed for the level (required)
   - lvlJc (str): The justification of the level text (required)
   - counter (Optional[int]): A counter for the level
   - indent (Optional[IndentationProperties]): The indentation properties for the level
   - tab_pt (Optional[float]): The tab position in points
   - fonts (Optional[FontProperties]): The font properties for the level
   Description: Models a single level within a numbering scheme, defining how that level should be formatted, numbered, and displayed. Supports various numbering formats like decimal, roman, bullet, etc.

2. NumberingInstance(BaseModel)
   Purpose: Represents an instance of a numbering definition
   Fields:
   - numId (int): The ID of the numbering definition (required)
   - levels (List[NumberingLevel]): The list of levels in the numbering definition (required)
   Description: Models a complete numbering definition that contains multiple levels. Each instance represents a specific numbering scheme that can be referenced by paragraphs.

3. NumberingSchema(BaseModel)
   Purpose: Represents the overall numbering schema for the document
   Fields:
   - instances (List[NumberingInstance]): The list of numbering instances in the document (required)
   Description: Top-level model that contains all numbering definitions for a document. This represents the complete numbering.xml content parsed into a structured format.

DEPENDENCIES:
- Pydantic for data validation and modeling
- styles_models module for FontProperties and IndentationProperties
- Standard typing module for type hints

DATA RELATIONSHIPS:
- NumberingSchema contains multiple NumberingInstance objects
- NumberingInstance contains multiple NumberingLevel objects
- NumberingLevel references FontProperties and IndentationProperties from styles_models
- Paragraphs reference numbering through numId and ilvl values

USAGE CONTEXT:
These models are used to represent the numbering system in DOCX documents, which handles numbered lists, bulleted lists, and multi-level lists. The numbering schema is parsed from the numbering.xml file within the DOCX package and is referenced by paragraphs that participate in lists. The hierarchical structure allows for complex nested lists with different formatting at each level.
