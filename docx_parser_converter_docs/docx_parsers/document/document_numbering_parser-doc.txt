DOCX PARSER CONVERTER - DOCUMENT_NUMBERING_PARSER.PY DOCUMENTATION
===================================================================

FILE PURPOSE:
This file contains the DocumentNumberingParser class that extracts and parses numbering properties from paragraph properties in DOCX documents. It handles the conversion of numbering XML elements into structured Numbering objects, which are essential for understanding ordered and unordered list formatting.

IMPORTS:
- lxml.etree: For XML parsing and manipulation
- typing.Optional: For type hints
- docx_parser_converter.docx_parsers.helpers.common_helpers: For XML helper functions (extract_element, extract_attribute)
- docx_parser_converter.docx_parsers.models.paragraph_models.Numbering: For numbering data model

FUNCTIONS:
None defined outside of classes.

CLASSES:

1. DocumentNumberingParser
   Purpose: Parses the numbering properties of a paragraph in a docx document
   Description: This class contains methods to parse the numbering properties from the paragraph properties (pPr) element of a docx document. The numbering properties are essential for understanding the ordered or unordered list formatting in the document.

   METHODS:

   parse(pPr: Optional[etree.Element]) -> Optional[Numbering] [STATIC METHOD]
   Purpose: Parses numbering from the given paragraph properties XML element
   Parameters:
   - pPr (Optional[etree.Element]): The paragraph properties XML element that can contain numbering properties which define the list level and list ID for the paragraph
   Returns: Optional[Numbering] - The parsed numbering, or None if not found
   Description: Extracts numbering information from paragraph properties to determine if a paragraph participates in a list. The method:
   
   1. Looks for the numbering properties element (w:numPr) within paragraph properties
   2. Extracts the indent level element (w:ilvl) which defines the nesting level
   3. Extracts the numbering ID element (w:numId) which references the numbering definition
   4. Converts attribute values to integers with default values (0) if not present
   5. Creates a Numbering object with the extracted level and ID
   6. Returns None if no numbering properties are found

   The method handles missing elements gracefully by providing default values, ensuring that partial numbering information can still be processed.

INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES:
None (static method class).

DATA MODELS USED:
- Numbering: Container for numbering properties including indent level (ilvl) and numbering ID (numId)

DEPENDENCIES:
- lxml for XML parsing
- Helper functions for XML element and attribute extraction
- Numbering model for structured data representation

USAGE CONTEXT:
This parser is used by paragraph parsers to determine if a paragraph is part of a numbered or bulleted list. The numbering information is crucial for:
- Rendering lists with proper indentation and numbering
- Understanding document structure and hierarchy
- Converting lists to other formats (HTML, plain text)
- Maintaining list formatting during document processing

NUMBERING COMPONENTS:
- Indent Level (ilvl): Determines the nesting level of the list item (0 = top level, 1 = first nested level, etc.)
- Numbering ID (numId): References a specific numbering definition that contains formatting rules for the list

DEFAULT VALUES:
- If ilvl element is missing: defaults to 0 (top level)
- If numId element is missing: defaults to 0 (first numbering definition)
- If entire numPr element is missing: returns None (paragraph is not part of a list)

ERROR HANDLING:
- Returns None if no paragraph properties element is provided
- Returns None if no numbering properties element is found
- Provides default values for missing numbering components
- Uses safe integer conversion with fallback values

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Uses static method design for stateless operation
- Handles both complete and partial numbering information
- Provides sensible defaults to ensure robust list processing
- Integrates with the broader numbering system for complete list support
